# SentiGrid — Privacy Policy
**Effective Date:** October 4, 2025

We respect your privacy. **SentiGrid** stores your API keys and preferences locally on your device. We do not collect or transmit personal data to our servers in the normal operation of the App.

## 1) Data We Handle
- **Local data:** API keys (e.g., Twelve Data, Alpha Vantage), preferences (symbols, granularity). Stored locally only (e.g., `%APPDATA%\SentiGrid\` on Windows) using local storage/electron-store.
- **Support:** If you email **sentigrid.help@gmail.com**, we receive your email address and any information you provide.

## 2) Third-Party APIs
If you enter keys, the App sends requests from your device to those providers, per your configuration. Their privacy policies apply.

## 3) Legal Bases (GDPR, EU/EEA)
For support inquiries, our legal basis is legitimate interests (responding to you). If we ever add analytics/telemetry, we will update this notice and request consent where required.

## 4) CCPA/CPRA (California)
We do not “sell” or “share” personal information. California residents may request access to or deletion of support-related data by contacting us.

## 5) PIPEDA (Canada)
We follow principles of consent, accountability, purpose limitation, and safeguards. You may request access/correction for support-related data.

## 6) Security
Keys are stored locally in plain JSON by default. Protect your device and backups. Rotate keys periodically and revoke them if you suspect compromise.

## 7) Retention
Support emails are retained for up to 12 months unless required longer by law or to resolve issues.

## 8) Children
The App is intended for users **18+**.

## 9) Changes
We may update this Policy. Continued use after changes means you accept the updated Policy.

## 10) Contact
Privacy requests: **sentigrid.help@gmail.com**
