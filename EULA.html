    The Software’s outputs are educational illustrations only and must <strong>not</strong> be relied upon to place real trades or to manage money for others. The Software is <strong>not</strong> designed for safety-critical environments.</p>

    <h2 id="2-restrictions">2) Restrictions</h2>
    <p>You will not:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>(a) copy, modify, adapt, translate, reverse-engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Software except where such restrictions are prohibited by law;</li>
      <li>(b) sell, rent, lease, sublicense, distribute, or create derivative works;</li>
      <li>(c) circumvent technical protections or usage limits;</li>
      <li>(d) extract or scrape data at a scale that violates third-party API terms or rate limits;</li>

    <h2 id="7-termination">7) Termination</h2>
    <p>This EULA remains effective until terminated. We may suspend or terminate your license at any time if you breach this EULA. Upon termination you must stop using and uninstall the Software. Sections <strong>4–12</strong> survive termination.</p>

    <h2 id="8-export-controls--legal-use">8) Export Controls &amp; Legal Use</h2>
    <p>You represent that you are not located in, and will not use the Software from, any country subject to embargoes or sanctions, and that you are not on any restricted-party list. You will comply with all applicable export-control, sanctions, and other laws.</p>

    <h2 id="9-disclaimer-of-warranties">9) Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p><strong>THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.”</strong> TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, SENTIGRID DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND ACCURACY OR TIMELINESS OF DATA. NOTHING IN THE SOFTWARE CONSTITUTES FINANCIAL, TRADING, OR INVESTMENT ADVICE.</p>

    <h2 id="10-limitation-of-liability">10) Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, SENTIGRID WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, LOST DATA, TRADING LOSSES, OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION), EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>

    <h2 id="14-miscellaneous">14) Miscellaneous</h2>
    <p><strong>Severability.</strong> If any part of this EULA is unenforceable, the remainder will remain in effect.<br>
    <strong>No waiver.</strong> A failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver.<br>

    <strong>Entire agreement.</strong> This EULA is the entire agreement regarding the Software.</p>

    <h2 id="15-privacy-in-app">15) Privacy (in-app)</h2>
    <p>The Software does <strong>not</strong> transmit your API keys or personal data to our servers. Keys are stored <strong>locally</strong> on your device (via <code>electron-store</code> or a local JSON fallback). The app may write local logs to help with troubleshooting; these remain on your device unless you choose to share them. We do not run telemetry or analytics. Third-party data providers you choose to use are subject to their own privacy policies.</p>

    <h2 id="16-risk-disclosure">16) Risk Disclosure</h2>
    <p>Markets are volatile and unpredictable. Data may be delayed, rate-limited, inaccurate, or incomplete. Any “Buy/Sell/Wait” output is an <strong>educational example only</strong> and <strong>not</strong> a signal or recommendation. You are solely responsible for decisions made using or inspired by the Software. Consider consulting a qualified financial professional.</p>

    <h2 id="17-third-party--open-source-notices">17) Third-Party &amp; Open-Source Notices</h2>
    <p>The Software may include third-party and open-source components licensed under their own terms. A third-party notices file may be included with the application package (e.g., <code>THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt</code> or <code>licenses.txt</code>). If not present, please see the respective libraries’ repositories for license texts.</p>
