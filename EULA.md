## 1) License Grant
SentiGrid grants you a personal, limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to install and use one copy of the Software on computers you own or control, solely for **personal, non-commercial educational** use.  
You may not use the Software to provide a service to others (e.g., hosted access, API, or “software as a service”).  
The Software’s outputs are educational illustrations only and must **not** be relied upon to place real trades or to manage money for others. The Software is **not** designed for safety-critical environments.

## 2) Restrictions
You will not:  
(a) copy, modify, adapt, translate, reverse-engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Software except where such restrictions are prohibited by law;  
(b) sell, rent, lease, sublicense, distribute, or create derivative works;  
(c) circumvent technical protections or usage limits;  
(d) extract or scrape data at a scale that violates third-party API terms or rate limits;  
(e) remove proprietary notices; or  
(f) use the Software for any unlawful purpose.

## 3) Ownership
The Software is licensed, not sold. The Software and all intellectual-property rights are owned by **Svetlana Sapunova** and/or licensors. Third-party trademarks and content are the property of their respective owners.

## 4) Third-Party Services & Data
The Software may access third-party services or data (e.g., Twelve Data, Alpha Vantage, TradingEconomics, FXSSI). Your use of those services is subject to their terms. Data may be delayed, unavailable, inaccurate, or incomplete. SentiGrid does not control or guarantee third-party data and is not responsible for it.

## 5) Updates & Changes
We may provide or install updates automatically. Features may change or be discontinued. Some updates may be required to continue using the Software.

## 6) Feedback & Open-Source
If you provide suggestions or feedback, you grant SentiGrid a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free right to use and incorporate them without restriction. The Software may include open-source components that are licensed under their own terms; see [Third-Party & Open-Source Notices](#17-third-party--open-source-notices).

## 7) Termination
This EULA remains effective until terminated. We may suspend or terminate your license at any time if you breach this EULA. Upon termination you must stop using and uninstall the Software. Sections **4–12** survive termination.

## 8) Export Controls & Legal Use
You represent that you are not located in, and will not use the Software from, any country subject to embargoes or sanctions, and that you are not on any restricted-party list. You will comply with all applicable export-control, sanctions, and other laws.

## 9) Disclaimer of Warranties
**THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.”** TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, SENTIGRID DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND ACCURACY OR TIMELINESS OF DATA. NOTHING IN THE SOFTWARE CONSTITUTES FINANCIAL, TRADING, OR INVESTMENT ADVICE.

## 10) Limitation of Liability
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, SENTIGRID WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, LOST DATA, TRADING LOSSES, OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION), EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  
SENTIGRID’S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS WILL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF **US$50** OR THE AMOUNTS YOU PAID (IF ANY) FOR THE SOFTWARE IN THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE THE CLAIM. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW CERTAIN LIMITATIONS; YOUR RIGHTS MAY VARY.

## 11) Indemnity
You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless SentiGrid from and against any claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to your unlawful use of the Software, your violation of this EULA, or your violation of third-party terms.

## 12) Governing Law; Venue
This EULA is governed by the laws of **Ontario, Canada**, without regard to conflict-of-laws principles. Venue is in Ontario courts.

## 13) Changes to this EULA
We may update this EULA from time to time. The “Effective Date” above will reflect the latest version. Continued use after changes become effective constitutes your acceptance of the revised EULA.

## 14) Miscellaneous
**Severability.** If any part of this EULA is unenforceable, the remainder will remain in effect.  
**No waiver.** A failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver.  
**Assignment.** You may not assign this EULA; we may assign it.  
**Force majeure.** We are not liable for delays or failures due to events beyond our reasonable control.  
**Entire agreement.** This EULA is the entire agreement regarding the Software.

## 15) Privacy (in-app)
The Software does **not** transmit your API keys or personal data to our servers. Keys are stored **locally** on your device (via `electron-store` or a local JSON fallback). The app may write local logs to help with troubleshooting; these remain on your device unless you choose to share them. We do not run telemetry or analytics. Third-party data providers you choose to use are subject to their own privacy policies.

## 16) Risk Disclosure
Markets are volatile and unpredictable. Data may be delayed, rate-limited, inaccurate, or incomplete. Any “Buy/Sell/Wait” output is an **educational example only** and **not** a signal or recommendation. You are solely responsible for decisions made using or inspired by the Software. Consider consulting a qualified financial professional.

## 17) Third-Party & Open-Source Notices
The Software may include third-party and open-source components licensed under their own terms. A third-party notices file may be included with the application package (e.g., `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt` or `licenses.txt`). If not present, please see the respective libraries’ repositories for license texts.
